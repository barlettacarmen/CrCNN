# CrCNN
Crypto-Convolutional Neural Network library written on top of SEAL 2.3.1

This library is able to convert a pretrained convolutional neural network into an encoded network and make predictions on homomorphic encrypted data.

## Requirements
- c++ compiler with c++-17 support
- Make
- SEAL 2.3.1
- hdf5 libraries (https://support.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/releases/hdf5-1.8/hdf5-1.8.20/src/hdf5-1.8.20.tar.gz)
