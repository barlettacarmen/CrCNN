	Computation=  each pixel in the sim_input is copied xf*yf times and then sum up them, because we suppose that all the pixels belonging to the same 
	channel are the same. Mathematically it is like multipling the pixel xf*yf. The copy is necessary to simulate exactly all the computations on a single pixel.
